# Quick Fix

Apply a quick fix to the current project's codebase without requiring a tracked issue. Intended for small changes such as CI fixes, documentation fixes, dependency upgrades, and other minor improvements.

## Usage

```
/oss-quick-fix <description>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<description>` - A brief description of the quick fix to apply

**Examples:**
```
/oss-quick-fix upgrade dependency version in pom.xml
/oss-quick-fix fix broken link in README
/oss-quick-fix update GitHub Actions workflow to latest version
```

## Instructions

### 1. Detect Project

Determine the current project by running:

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Match the output against the remote patterns to determine the project directory:
- `wanaku-ai/wanaku` -> `wanaku`
- `wanaku-ai/wanaku-capabilities-java-sdk` -> `wanaku-capabilities-java-sdk`
- `wanaku-ai/camel-integration-capability` -> `camel-integration-capability`
- `apache/camel` -> `camel-core`
- `apache/camel-quarkus` -> `camel-quarkus`
- `apache/camel-spring-boot` -> `camel-spring-boot`
- `apache/camel-kafka-connector` -> `camel-kafka-connector`
- `apache/camel-k` -> `camel-k`
- `hawtio/hawtio` -> `hawtio`
- `KaotoIO/kaoto` -> `kaoto`
- `KaotoIO/forage` -> `forage`
- `orpiske/ai-agents-oss-helper` -> `ai-agents-oss-helper`

If no match is found, fall back to the `generic-github` rules directory. Extract the GitHub org/repo from the remote URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo.git` or `git@github.com:org/repo.git` -> `org/repo`) and use it as the project's GitHub repository for all operations.

Once matched, read the project's rule files from the corresponding subdirectory:
- `<project>/project-info.md` - Repository metadata, issue tracker, related repos
- `<project>/project-standards.md` - Build tools, commands, code style
- `<project>/project-guidelines.md` - Branching, commits, PR policies

### 2. Parse Input

Extract the description from the argument. This describes the quick fix to apply.

### 3. Validate Scope

Before proceeding, verify the change qualifies as a quick fix. Acceptable changes include:

- **CI/CD fixes** - GitHub Actions workflows, build scripts
- **Documentation fixes** - Typos, broken links, outdated instructions
- **Dependency upgrades** - Version bumps in `pom.xml` or other build files
- **Minor code fixes** - Trivial corrections that don't alter behavior
- **Configuration changes** - Small updates to project configuration

If the change is too large or complex (e.g., new features, architectural changes, refactoring), stop and suggest the appropriate action from the project's `project-guidelines.md` (e.g., `/oss-create-issue` for GitHub projects, or creating a Jira issue for Jira projects).

### 4. Locate Relevant Files

Based on the description:

1. Search for relevant files in the codebase
2. Understand what needs to change
3. Confirm the change is minimal and low-risk

### 5. Implement the Fix

Apply changes following these principles:

- **Minimal** - Change only what is strictly necessary
- **Safe** - Do not alter existing behavior or APIs
- **Clean** - Keep code readable and consistent with surrounding style
- **Tested** - If the change touches code (not docs/CI), verify tests still pass

Read the project's `project-standards.md` for project-specific build constraints (e.g., no Records/Lombok for camel-core, module-specific builds, etc.).

### 6. Workflow

Read branch naming and commit format from the project's `project-guidelines.md`.

1. **Branch**: Create from main with a descriptive name
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b quick-fix/<short-slug>
   ```
   Use a short slug derived from the description (e.g., `quick-fix/upgrade-quarkus-bom`, `quick-fix/fix-readme-typo`).

2. **Implement**: Make the necessary changes

3. **Format & Build**: Run the build commands from the project's `project-standards.md`
   - For projects with module-specific builds (camel-core): run formatting in the module directory first, then test
   - For documentation-only changes, the build step may be skipped if no code was modified
   - For projects with no build tool (ai-agents-oss-helper): skip build

4. **Commit**: Use the quick-fix commit format from the project's `project-guidelines.md`
   ```bash
   git add <changed-files>
   git commit -m "chore: <brief description>"
   ```

5. **Push**: Push the branch to origin
   ```bash
   git push -u origin quick-fix/<short-slug>
   ```

6. **Pull Request**: Create a pull request
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "chore: <brief description>" --body "<short explanation of what was changed and why>"
   ```

### 7. Constraints

You MUST:
- Work on a dedicated branch (never commit to `main`)
- Create a pull request after pushing
- Keep changes small and focused
- Include formatting changes from the build in your commit
- For camel-core: always run `mvn` in the module directory; do NOT parallelize Maven jobs

You MUST NOT:
- Make large or behavioral changes without an issue
- Refactor unrelated code
- Skip the build for code changes
- Combine multiple unrelated fixes in a single quick fix
- Push directly to `main`
- For camel-core: change public method signatures

### 8. Acceptance Criteria

- All tests pass for code changes (using the test command from the project's `project-standards.md`)
- Changes are minimal and match the described fix
- A pull request has been created with a clear title and description
- Work is done on a branch, not on `main`
